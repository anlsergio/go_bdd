# Golang BDD

This repository holds the result/practice of my study around implementing Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD) and Behavior Driven Development (BDD) by using Golang.

## [Parking Lot API](parking_lot)

This is a backend application designed to fullfil a request from a frontend squad of developers at the dummy's Southeast Airports Inc.

Nowadays Southeast Airports Inc. parking lot managers are having a hard time on their daily activities due to the lack of automation on parking lot cost calculation.

So far, for every customer who drops their car at 5 different parking lot modalities, the parking lot staff have to do the math manually, and they claim that it takes a considerable amount of time, if you consider a busy day, and also they are concerned that a manual task like this is pretty error prone.
